### Running the exercises

See the top-level README for how to run the exercises. This lesson's exercises
are in the `lessons/00x_cat_name_fluffy` directory.

If you run into problems, it may be because your vagrant box is out of date. You
can run `vagrant box outdated` to check, and then `vagrant box update` to update
the image. You then need to destroy your local box and restart it, with `vagrant
destroy` and `vagrant up`.
